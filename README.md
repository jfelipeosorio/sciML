# Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning Workshop

Location: MindLab at Universidad Nacional de Colombia

In this workshop The attendees of this three-day workshop will learn about three techniques in the developing field of "Scientific Machine Learning", which applies concepts to numerous applications in science and engineering. Examples of using the aforementioned approaches to solve and learn differential equations that typically occur when describing a particular phenomena of research include using neural networks, kernel methods, and sparse regression-based algorithms. Each session will begin with a discussion of the theoretical background material before moving into a hands-on section (a laptop with internet connectivity is sufficient to run Colab notebooks that will be provided), during which we hope to run each algorithm and discuss some of the computing benefits and drawbacks of each technique.
